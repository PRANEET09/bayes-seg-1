==========
were now entering the part of eight oh one which is the most difficult for student in faculty like
we re going to enter the domain of angular momentum and torques is extremely non intuitive
the good news however is that we ll stay if we face concept for these four five lectures
today i will introduce both torque
and angular momenta
was angular momentum of an object has a mass m
and it has a velocity v
then clearly it has a momentum
v that s very well defined you reference frame the product of m and v
then the momentum
i can take relative to any point i choose i d choose this point q arbitrary this now
is the position vector which i call r q
but this angle theta
and angular momentum will relative to that point q it s a vector
is the position vector relative to that point q cross b
so it is our was cute
cross v and then times m
now in magnitude so often the angular momentum relative to point q
is of course are m v that then i have to take the sine of the angle theta
so let s say it is m v r sine of theta
and this i often call short and notation are perpendicular that s
are perpendicular is this distance
relative to point c
but you just saw may have confuse u n for good reason because i changed by index q to see
and there is no see the index the should all be q of course
so is our is the length of this vector that is the magnitude of this vector so they should have the q
and our cues sine theta
which i call are perpendicular
must have an index q
and that is this part here
this angle is ninety degrees and this here is r of q
perpendicular know season all
only cues i m sorry for that
the the direction of the angular momentum is easy you know how to do we ll cross product so in this case
arc cross v would be
perpendicular to the blackboards
and the magnitude is also easy to calculate
now comes the difficult problem with angular momentum
if i chose any point on this line say point c
then the angular momentum relative to point c is zero
very obvious because
the position vector r
and the velocity vector in this case and the same direction so theta is zero so the sine of theta is zero
so you immediately see that angular momentum is not an intrinsic property of them moving object like momentum
which is an intrinsic property
if you sit there in twenty six one hundred you see an object moving with a certain velocity it has a certain mass you know it s momentum
what s the angular momentum is depends on the point that you choose all your point of origin if you have chosen this point d
then the angular momentum would even be this way
because when your point here the position vector then they see are cross v is now coming
the blackboard
and this is why angular momentum
in such a difficult concept but we re on the side it in a way that it will be very useful
suppose i d throw up an object
twenty six one hundred
and at time t equals zero the object is here and at time t the object is there
so this then is the position vector at time t the object
starts off with a certain velocity v
and a little later here say the velocity is like so
and there is of course the force on it and j which makes these curve
what is the angular momentum relative two points see at time zero the angular momentum
it s clearly zero because the point it s self the mast itself is at points see
so the position vector has no length so it s clear that is zero
what is the angular momentum at time t when the object is here well what angular momentum
is clearly not zero because you see here
position vector and you see the velocity so clearly the angular momentum lost changing
now you will say of course it was changing big deal
because angular momentum has a velocity vector read it and here the velocity vector is changing all the time
so obviously you would say the angular momentum is changing well
yes that is not a bad argument but i will now show you a case where the velocity is changing all the time
okay but where angular momentum is not changing
i choose
we re is going around the sun
here s the earth s with mass m at point see here is the sun
this it the position vector r of see
and and the earth has a certain tangential velocity
and the speed
never change it s about the velocity dust changed so this is the position vector at a later point in time
what now is the angular momentum off the light going around the sun
relative to point c i pick see now
well that angular momentum if i take the
the magnitude of the angular momentum
because the direction is immediately obvious if the object is going around like this this is the position vector then he
direction will be pointing out of the blackboard that s easy
so i only work now about the
the magnitude so the magnitude is the mass of the earth s times the magnitude
often the cross product
between these two vectors
and notice the angle is ninety degrees
so i can forget about across the sine of theta is one and so i simply get them are
the the v now being the speed
this case when the object is here but when the objects here the situation has not changed again
are cross v the magnitude is exactly the same because the sine of the angle hasn t changed
and so you see here okay so by the velocity is changing all the time
but the angular momentum relative to point c is not changing
suppose i chosen point q
is a romance do changing relative to point q you better believe it
there is a time that the object will go through point q build any and you re magnum it can be zero because the position vector is zero
if the object is here and gentlemen the relative to point q for sure or yeah momentum is not zero
you have a position vector and you have a velocity
so in
right if if two points see is a very special case now
is angular momentum not changing so angular momentum
is conserved in this special case but only about points see
then i want to address that s it a little bit more general way
==========
i take the angular momentum and i choose a point q
and i notice the definition is position vector relative to point q
cross p
i take the derivative if time derivative d l d t
relative to that point cues always important
that you stayed which point to have chosen
relative to which you take n and momentum that is going to be
the are
the t i
to say cross p
plus r
of q costs the p d t is is the way that you take the
time derivative of the cross product
we calculate the angular momentum relative to point q
so the index has to be cute for out the equation the position vector relative to point q
and in this equation use see the correct index q here use to do correct index q here
but i slipped up here and i put a c there
there is no see this problem
so this is also r of q
sorry for that this here
is the velocity of the object
the velocity vector which is always in the same direction as the
so this is zero
d p the t v
that is the force on the object
we see that before in eight oh one and so now we have that
d l the t
but if to a point q the calls
the position vector r
from that point across f
and this now is what we call torque
and we write for that the symbols tall is a vector
and i put in that q we get
and this is one of the most important equations that will stay with its for at least
fight lectures what is is telling you it is that if there is a torque
on an object the angular momentum must be changing in time if there is no torque on the object angular momentum
will be conserved and now you get some insight into this situation that we just discussed
the force the attractive force
gravitational force
exerted on the earth
is in this direction the
position vector is in this direction so are cross f is zero
there is no torque relative to this point c
but the angle between the two vectors is hundred eighty degrees and so the sine of the angle is zero
therefore no matter where you lie on the circle
always are cross f will be zero there is no torque relative to point c
but if you take point q or you take here s some point they clearly
but is going to be the pork
the changing forty for and so there
you will have a change of angular momenta
so something very special about that point c out will come back to get of course
now i want to expand the idea of angular momentum from
==========
one point objects that moves in space too
but objects like a sphere or like a disk which is rotating about its center of mass
and i will start with the disk
here we have a disk the disk has mass and
and the disk has radius r
and at this point c is the center of mass of this disk
it s rotating this angular velocity omega
and i want to know what the angular momentum is of these rotating disk
the direction of the angle mentally going to be trivial
it it s a rotating like this if you take here a little mass element
mass m of i this is the
position vector r of i relative to that point c
and here you have
the velocity v of i
and you see immediately that are crawls v is coming out of the blackboard so that s easy
by momentum will be in this direction and what is the magnitudes of the disk as a whole well
let s first calculate what the angular momentum is of this little mass elements about this point so l c
for mass element by
you call so let s just only worry about magnitude because already know the direction so that is them of i i
and then the crust what it would be r of i envy of i
but this angle is ninety degrees so i can forget about the
sine of theta so i simply get r of i d of our
car if i relative to that point c
times v of i this is the magnitude
no i hate to see if you ve i know rotating this because the velocity
will depend or how far you are away from the center the velocity here is zero
however they all have mean guy in common every single element that you choose it s the same omega
so i m always going to replace in the case like this v by omega r and so this then becomes
am a vine
r of i will see i get a square here
and i get omega
so i wrote down v equals omega or which of course wholesome general
it would have been better perhaps if i had written down you ve i
equals omega
times r of i
because each element little i i
which has a position vector r of i
has a velocity which is given by p u of i you could make
i ll find
but i condense that s
thing one equation vehicles omega are
but this is the connection that ll make it perhaps easy for you to understand what follows
for that is the angular momentum for this little mass elements
but now i want to know what the entire again momentum is
about that point season axes going through the center of mass of the center of the disk perpendicular to the blackboard
and now of course i have to do the
summation of all these elements i i can bring the omega outside
and i would have then the summation of them of i
r of i relative to that point c squared
and you see immediately i hope for to see immediately
that this is the moment of inertia for
the spin around the center of mass for that point c
and so i can write for this i will see
times omega
now comes the question to this is the magnitude now comes the question is this angular momentum
different for instance for this point a
and your first reaction will be yeah of course because it depends on the point you choose
well the remarkable thing is that if you have a rotation
about the center of mass which i have chosen here
then even if you calculate the angular momentum relative to this point or any other point even this point in space
you always find the same answer
but only in case that there is a rotation about the center of mass
and we call that this in angular momentum the spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property
of an object regardless of which point you choose relative to which you calculate the angular momentum
so in the case that
but object is spinning about its center of mass
you no longer have to specify the point that you have chosen your point of origin you can really talk now about the
angular momenta
the other is spinning about its center of mass
so the left has an intrinsic
spin angular momentum in addition
it has the orbital angular momentum
if you
talk about the orbital angular momentum of the u s however
you better do it relative to that point otherwise
it would be changing in time it s only uniquely defined
if you take this special point
because only about that point which is the location of the sun
if the angular momentum the orbital angular momentum
of the earth not changing
==========
i m learning good their level experiment with you and that is called i skaters the light
you will see that it is not a light at all
but in any case it is definitely a pond experiments
i have here turntable
very little friction
and i m going to rotate the turntable about the center
and i m going to stand on that current able
and i will hold in my hands
to weights
these two
there it s about one point eight kilograms
so these weights and
one point eight kilograms
my entire mass including the turntable my body but say is about seventy five kilograms
and i m
ask someone to give me a little twist to rotate the about
this axis of symmetry
rotate me say if you look from below let s say i wrote i mean rotate clockwise
so we have here a situation of a rotation about the center of mass we can talk about
dean intrinsic angular momentum of this rotating system and he
angular momentum vector will obviously be pointing up words that s clear
if you rotate clockwise from the low
a member here you will rotate in counterclockwise is coming out of the blackboard here you rotate clockwise the the going up
so far so good
there s a force on the router brevity and g
no concern there isn t the call the strong force normal force up in the two cancel each other around
one i haven t been given a certain rotation is certain angular velocity
pull my arms in and pull my arms out it ll them arms in
and when i do that then does not because in net torque on the system
i can keep doing that all the time and there s no network
and so angular momentum
as we have specified for spitting object must be
surface cannot chains out equals i omega
what does like all my arms in
my moment of inertia will go die
and of them i moment of inertia goes down that any of this product has to remain constant
my angular velocity must go up
and vice versa of the wide boom arms in i will go faster and when i do this i will go slower
and i
be a little bit called it a beef with you i
simplify my own body
y and you re metric object for which i can calculate the moment of inertia which is a cylinder
i made of look like a cylinder but
close enough all practical purposes
and the seven there has a radius
of about twenty centimeters not too bad even
fits me
and i m going to rotate this similar about this axis
and i can calculate now what the mom and and attaches the circle has a mass seventy five kilograms
has a radius of twenty centimeters
and so the moment of inertia
in a situation that for instance i have these two objects next to my body here
why have them like here so this is my short and notation
equals simple one half m r squared remember that was the
moment of inertia we discussed that last time
of the rotating disk which rotates about the
line symmetry
and so if i put in the numbers here
the seventy five kilograms
and i take a radius of twenty centimeters then i found that this is about one point five
in our m k s units but now
i m going to put my arms like this
and now the moment of inertia will go up
and i ll make a very crude calculation how much it goes up
the my arm length is about ninety setting it is
the weight hear our one point eight kilograms
so i just assumed that
i got my arms that the weights for simplicity that all the weight is in these two objects
it s this and verification but you ll see a dramatic change and that s all wanted to see
so now the moment of inertia
when my arms i like this of course is my body which is the one point five
that still there but now there s an additional components
what i m from this mass
which is m r squared
and one for this mass which is m r squared with this is now that radius r
and so i get twice that mass
and then i have to take r squared
which is oh point nine squared
and i have to take the one point eight
but that s the moment of inertia of this object
about this point that is an r squared i assume that my arm is no man s and when you add this up
you find four and half
in m k s units kilograms meters squared
and now you see if i go from this situation to this
my moment of inertia goes down by a factor of three
and by moment of inertia goes down by a factor of three i angular velocity must go up by fax referred and vice versa
i
do this experiment with this experiment is not without danger
the problem is is experiment is that the moment that you pull your arms in
you get immediate extremely busy i you can lose your balance
and you can four flat out on the floor and i ve just talk this morning because some students here would be that in high school and
he told me that in the one of the teachers went flat down and i d try not to do that today
so i need really assistant from someone
horrible i can trust you think i can trust you not you
that s enormous answer your strong man you can that can i trust you
the first thing i want you to do
is to help me get on here because even getting on here is not easy if i just
i ll probably fall
okay so a stand there for your arm around my neck support this strongly now
okay
know ride their ego bust a ways it for awhile it s okay to stay there
all right
now you give me a reasonable
angular velocity where everything gives reasonable i ll tell you of it completely unreasonable
if we push
that s fine allowed it is it s fine now you walk a little bit away if i fall try to catch me
okay my arms go in now my arms go out
my article in
my arms go out
okay now i m completely dizzy nowadays no joke to stop me not just hold it
the this whole the whole me
working in my hands okay okay you pass the course
sacrificed for the sake of science or
i
alright i ve done worse
==========
we have a a collection of many points
like we re only discussed with
momentum
or that interact with each other
there could be stars
gravitation interact with the object which i connected with springs
they have internal interaction switch go all all the time they bounce of each other they collide
they break up in pieces
internal friction anything
then if i take two of these objects if this one for instance is attracted
towards this one then action equals minus reaction and these two force is identical in magnitude
so if i take any point q here no matter where you choose it that will never put a torque on that system
because the two force is cancel each other out
and so now we get the final
conservation of angular momentum it s all its glory if only we end here one
little words external
the angular momentum of the system this was angular momentum of just one object
yeah yeah momentum of a system of many particles they could be connected with springs
there could be chemical explosions going on they couldn t fall into each other they could way each other out
the angular momentum will not change
if there is no net external torque on that system
because all the internal fox torques cancel out because action
equals minus reaction
so if we now compare conservation of angular momentum with conservation of momentum that in the case
if the conservation of momentum remember
when we had a system of objects
in the absence of an external force on the system as a whole net external force momentum was concerned
now we have with a system of particles in the absence or the net external torque
and you momentum is conserved
in a case off the ice skaters the lights when you pull your arms in
the moment of inertia goes down and so your frequency goes up
when a star streams
this radius goes down
if
know in a shack goes down and therefore
its angular velocity must go up
moment of inertia goes with r squared
what determines the size of a star
if this is a star
then inside the star is the furnace nuclear furnace new career fusion is going on
that produce is heat and pressure
which wants to expand the star
on the other hand there is gravity which says sorry you can do that i want to
hold you together in fact gravity would like to collapse the star
and nature find a balance between the gravity and this pressure do too
the nuclear furnace another comes a time
that the nuclear furnace has been completely consumed
force on that takes an additional five billion years the sun has already being burning
nuclear fuel for five billion years has no finite billion to go
and once the nuclear fuel has be consumed
there are three and products off the
gadgets bar that is left over
and these three end products are the following number one
it s called white dwarf
it has a radius approximately the same as the earth sun and thousand kilometers
and a mass of a white dwarf is a whole range of dumb quit a typical number say is half the mass of the sum
but that s one possible and products
this will be the fate of our son by the way
the density of such an object is quite high some ten to the rope
will be roughly ten to this six grams per cubic centimeter
uh another possibility is that you end up with a neutron star
a neutron star has a radius of about ten kilometers
kilometers
and it has a mass of roughly
one point five times the mass of the sun and its density
is about ten to the fourteen grams per cubic centimeter which even higher than the density of nuclei
and and there is a possibility which is even more bizarre that you end up with a black hole
i will not talk about black holes to david i would ve back to that later in eight oh one and a black hole
for all practical purposes has no size it all
the mass of the black hole must be larger than we think three solar masses and so the density
is infinitely high
whether you add up to be wide were for neutron star or black hole depend only
mass all the to the of the pole jet after all the star that collapse when if you will in the new q two was got
and in order to form a neutron star you would have to start off
with a spiral of probably at least and solar mass is maybe even more so our sun will not become a neutron star
but our sun will ultimately become a white dwarf
now only reasonable question to ask why the land of only with these three possibilities why is there nothing in between
looked it is which different from ten thousand kilometers
to ten kilometer is done nothing in between
and the answer to that lies in quantum mechanics which is not part of this course but you will see that in eight oh five white only these two
and then if you get into general relativity then you ll understand why there is then this for it s
very bizarre possibility
when the star collapse is two things happen
first of all there is a huge amount of gravitational potential energy that is released in the form of kinetic energy
the stuff all then we call a gravitational collapse and that gravitational potential energy converts the kinetic energy and that ultimately
converts to heat and to radiation if i take an object here a piece of shock
and i draw that
that you can call gravitational collapse
gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and ultimately it goes to his
here we talking about the star
which is in coding collapsing and the amount off
gravitational potential energy that become available are enormous
in addition to this huge amount of energy released the star must pay now
because its moment of inertia goes down
and therefore the angular velocity must go up
i want to do a little bit of quantitative work on this
and i
take an object like our sun
and i would like to collapse that object
from its present radius of the sun which is about seven hundred thousand kilometers
i want to collapse that two neutron star
was a radius of ten kilometers even though i know when i told you that the sun will not become a
neutron star it just to get some feeling for the numbers
so we take an object like the sun
which has a radius of about
seven hundred thousand kilometers
and we re going to collapse that two neutron star which has a radius of about
ten kilometers
the mass of the sun is
two times ten to the thirty kilograms
and for those of you or good at math they can calculate
when you collapsed this object without losing any match you keep all the mass what you sure a kid to ten kilometers
how much gravitational potential energy is released
and that is this bag or a number
and i call that delta i you
is a lots of gravitational potential energy which is about
ten to the forty six in joules
and this number is truly
mind boggling
this is converted to kinetic energy
and then it is converted to heat and all forms of radiation
to give you feeling for how it s certainly large this number is if you take the sun
and you take all the energy that the sun produces in it s ten billion years that it will have
the total energy output of the sun is hundred times less than this number and this comes out in in matter of seconds
so it is mind boggling i d hear
that the sun is producing and ten million years the lifetime of the sun is producing or less energy
then what happens during a stellar collapse two neutron star
hundred times less
so indeed in follow occurs in this huge amount of energy is released
the outer layer bounces off the end of core and is expelled
and that s what we call a supernova explosion the outer layers are for off
with speed typically some ten thousand kilometers
per second our sun will not become a neutron star but it will become a white for
we talk about the crab nebula next time last time in the crab nebula is a remnant of a supernova explosion which occurred
believe it or not on the fourth of july
in the year thousand fifty four talking about fireworks
the supernova explosion
was noticed by chinese and so by astronomers
they called is a guest star
chinese astronomers were very prestige is
the reason for that was that these chinese astronomers and vice the emperor they re look at the sky
and they to right
from the sky information that was t for the emperor be you how to interpret the occurrence of comets
or for instance shooting stars or a particular line of of planets and certainly the appearance of a guest star
and a wooden know that for instance a comet in a certain part of the sky
might mean that there would be hunger or that would be diseases that would be fat in
or would be a good time for a battle of the bat time for battle and that s what s
these people were doing it with slicing the emperor
and therefore they were keeping a very close i on the sky no
but in flight
this star are
was visible four weeks during the day when it exploded
and it was the brightest star in the sky for
here s to come
it is a complete huh so
white isn t a single reports by any european astronomer on your current of this supernova of thousand fifty four
is very puzzling
now you can argued that in the netherlands end it england always cloud it s always raining so you can see the sky okay i granted that
but then we of italy and we have sprayed and we have france
and it is very strange it must be a cultural think somehow in the eleventh century somehow
you re up was not interested in looking at the sky this is something they could not have missed
but they didn t write it down
i now want to pursue the spin out of the star
when it collapse is from seven hundred thousand kilometers to ten kilometers
if we won t know what s off a little bit
then the reduction in radius is about hundred thousand
it really only seventy thousand the batches make that
a hundred thousand dent to the fixed
that means r square goes down
by factor ten billion
and if r square goes down by a factor of ten million
than the moment of inertia goes down by a factor of ten billion
and so omega must go up
by a factor of ten billion if you re started off with the star
that rotate it about its own axes in hundred days it ends up rotating around
in one milliseconds when it has become a neutron star
and if on stark ten kilometers
that has about the same now has of the sun a little more and it s bins around
in one milliseconds at the equator all of the neutron star you reach about twenty percent of the speed of light
we know how and so neutron stars in the sky
to ozone have in fact rotational period of one and have
milliseconds many of them much slower and we discussed last time why that is because remember in the case of the crap pulsar
the pulsar slowdown nature
it s happening on the rotational kinetic energy of these pulsars and is converting it s into other forms of energy
in the case of the crap pulsar radio emission optical emission gum race x rays and even
jets the crap also was slowing down every day
thirty six point four not a seconds
whistle that was staggering power output i still remember the number i think six times ten to thirty one wants
in seventy five years the pulsar slows down by one many seconds so this thirty
three milliseconds would become thirty four milliseconds in seventy five years
there s the star has a know original
there s no start it was a disk right
if the star has an original magnetic field which most stars do
oh i lost my star but that s okay
that and in the collapse the magnetic field will become stronger
and this is something you will learn about an eight oh two why it becomes strongest so most of these neutron stars has strong magnetic fields
and most rotate very fast
and for reasons that we don t quite understand many of them blink at us they bring out us
in radio emission real reason there too
the initial radio mission like a lighthouse going out for me
two magnetic poles of the neutron star and as a neutron star rotates you wonders of it sweeps over you
you see radio emission radio mission you see nothing to radio emission use your radio emission so many pulsars
or beam doesn t sleep over the earth we would never be able to see of course
and in the case of the pulsar and the crap it s even more special because that pulsar
also blinks at us in the optical in the x rays and in the gum rains
and so now i would like to
sure you
some slides
and discussing little bit more detail the supernova
explosions and and the
fabulous light output
==========
and the spin out of
so i have to make it quite dark
make it completely dark
there we go
and so the first slide
is simply a artist conception though take this too seriously all of these
beams of radio emission
this is that a rotating neutron star
and if the axis of rotation doesn t coincide with the magnetic dipole axis and if you have these
radio beams which we do not understand how they are forms they you can see
but they rotate how they can sweet oh from
now you may say well that s a little bit artificial
because why would the axis of rotation
the different from the magnetic dipole axis well that is not an exceptional all in astronomy your worst itself
as a magnetic dipole axis with does not coincide with the axis of rotation
is that almost all the planets in our planetary system have a magnetic dipole axis with makes a large angle
with the axis of rotation for that s the will in astronomy water then the exception
even though it may not be easy to understand that
and these blue line then represent the magnetic field lines we ll see more than that you like when you take
eight oh two
and here is jocelyn bell
jocelyn bell was a graduate students under antony hewish e k which england and she discovered
pulsars she found in the radio data which four okay
using and new telescope that antony hewish had bills she found in there
periodic signals
ball sits if you want to call them
you see some of them here at the bottom
and there were one point three seconds apart
actually reported that to anthony
and antony said well that
be nonsense of course mean there s not an object in the sky to is going to
give as pulses with the separation of one point three seconds so they just assumed that it was caused by an elevator by be be
milk and call machines or things of that nature motorcycles and so they d it every conceivable thing
to check whether india to this was a man made phenomenal but
they could not find anything and it was g oscillating
through rain credible billions
course able to convinced antony that in the base is an object
that is in the sky and that the radiation doesn t come from the earth
and when they realize that they realize that this would be the discovery off
not only the sensory but of all of mankind because they set
well who would possibly sends radio beans at us and model ate them
with a period of one point three seconds only intelligent life can do that
and so they call this first object little green man the just before they published
they discovered is in nineteen sixty seven by the way they found a seconds
pulsar which had a slightly different frequency
then the one point three second period and so then they realize that
it was probably not intelligent life
but that it was an astronomical object
so they gave that second object and a little green man true with a band that that idea very quickly
now comes the sad part of the story
in nineteen seventy four entity you which was awarded the nobel prize for this discovery and jocelyn
well you are then deserved it or lost a discoverer was the person
well true that this was astronomical it not share in the nobel prize it is of setting
it is said i discussed it with jocelyn several times i know we re quite well
and she takes it actually very likely to lightly i think
oh still people feel unhappy about it and still after so many years the nobel prize was awarded in nineteen seventy four
every time that i think about this magnificent discovery
and i think about also in i think about these grows in just this
here we see the crab nebula again we ve seen it before
the rat elements that you see here are the result of matter that was blown off
when the implosion occurred and when the outer layers bounce off the unit for
and or easily it they had a speed of about ten thousand kilometers per second
and by now it is about thousand years later these speeds have redo as being reduce somewhat
it here at the center you see the
pulsar and last time i sure you convincing evidence
that this is the pulsar because it s breaking at us it has a diameter of about seven like years
and the distance from us of about five thousand light years in terms of angular size in the sky
it s about five arc minute in size which is about one six of the
angular diameter of the moon
this is a drawing cave drawing made by novel instance and some people have speculate it to what extent
the novel indians may have seen the supernova in thousand fifty four it s on clear but it s a possibility
the most certainly gets very close to the supernova but also get very close to venus and so
this is something that is not well established but it is a possibility
here you see a galaxy
in which a supernova oh current
and when a supernova occurs at its wide this
it can the brighter that all hundred billion stars in the galaxy that s how much energy is released in optical light
we see that it is at least as bright as the entire galaxy
on this picture to this picture is about one year this occurred in nineteen seventy two
and over the period of one here
you can still see this star quite clearly but has an interesting strengths
quite a bit
and then a great thing happens
in february nineteen eighty seven
on the twenty third oh february
the supernova went off in the large magellanic clouds which is a
satellite galaxy to our own galaxy
to distance of about a hundred fifty thousand light years
and there was an astronomer
was observing in south america has name is even shell and
and he collected own to look at the stars and he decided that to take a p outside
and as he was taking the the bees wasn t own words
you looked at a large bag in the clouds and he said hey
that is funny that star is not supposed to be there
and he was a discoverer of what is now known as nineteen eighty seven a
an enormous supernova going off so close to where we live
and the next slide shows you just a portion of the large magnetic out and you can clearly see
that there is a very bright star he could see this was a snake and i
this is a picture
made by the hubble space telescope
off supernova nineteen eighty seven a
the in a ring that you see
is the result
all of matter that was thrown off by
this r before it went into supernova explosion some twenty five thousand years earlier
it expelled gas it equator is is reading a circle know used
it looks like about it because of the rejection of fact
and this real of matter moved out with a speed of about eight kilometers per second
and this has a radius of about eight like months
and so eight months after the supernova explosion
the ultra violet light in the x rays from the supernova called up with this ring of matter
and they excited it s and it became visible before a supernova explosion is wearing walls knots
visible we expecting in a few years that the matter itself
that was thrown off with a much more mellow speed of about ten thousand kilometers per second
that that matter will also plow into this ring and then we expect some we ll
fireworks again
there s no explanation that people agree upon
for these to call our glass rings they re quite mysterious
and there have papers rent them and it s and people disagree on their origin
super now the explosions in our galaxy and in the
large my
clouds are quite aware
we expect no more than about one
ins hundred years
the previous one that could be seen with make and i i
whereas in the year six you know for school camper supernova
in nineteen eighty seven a was really do first that could be studied with modern equipment radio
observatory x ray observatory is in orbit around the earth
with some like you may see a supernova explosion naked eye in your life the chances no better than ten percent
so maybe it will help it occasionally you take a p outside
and you become is famous as even showed and it s who is now very famous man
see you monday
