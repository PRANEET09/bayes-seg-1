==========
all right last time we talk exclusively about
implicit inelastic collisions
today i will talk about emissions in more general from
let s take a one dimensional case
we have here m one and we have here and to and
to make life a little easy to make the v two zero
and this particle has velocity v one
after the collision and two
has a velocity v two prime and
them one letter have a velocity v one prime
i don t even know whether it s in this direction or this in that direction you will see it here one is possible
to find the one prime and to find v two prime it s clear that you re now need to equations
and if there is no net external force on the system as a whole
during the collisions then momentum is conserved and so you can write down that and one
v one must be m one v one prime
plus m two v two prime
now you may want to put arrows over that to indicate that these are vectors distance is the one dimensional case you can these the arrows off
and the signs will then automatically take care of the direction if you call this plus
than if you get a minus sign you know that the velocities in the opposite direction
so now we
need the second equation
bind physics we do believe very strongly in the conservation of energy
not necessarily in the conservation of kinetic energy actually have seen last time you can destroy kinetic energy
but somehow we believe that if you re destroy energy it must come out in some other form
and you cannot create energy out of nothing
and in the case of the complete the inelastic emissions that we ve seen last time
we lost kinetic energy which was converted to heat
there was a internal friction with the car wreck plow into each other
that was internal friction no external friction and that took out kinetic energy and so in
it s most general form
you can write down that the kinetic energy before the collision plus some number q equals
the kinetic energy after the collision and if you know q then you have the second equation
and then you can solve for v one prime and forty two prime
if q is a larger than zero
then you have okay gain kinetic energy that is possible we did that last time we had
two cars which were connected by a spring and we weren t a wire
and each went off in the opposite direction the was no kinetic energy before
if you
call the the collision but the what s kinetic energy afterwards
that was the potential energy of the spring
that was converted into kinetic energy
so q can be larger than zero we call that a super elastic collision
could be an explosion that s the super elastic collision and then there s a possibility that q
equals zero very special case we will deal with that today and we call that
elastic collision
i will often call it a completely elastic collision which is really not necessary elastic
itself or eighty means q is zero
and then there is a case which we have seen
several examples last time of the elastic collisions when you lose kinetic energy so this is in in
elastic collision
and so if you know q is then you
can solve these equations whenever q is less than zero whenever you lose kinetic energy the loss in general goes into
eat now i want to
continue a case whereby i have a completely elastic collision
so q is zero
momenta this can surface because there was no net external force so now kinetic energy is also conserve
and so i can write down now one hot and one
v one screen that was the kinetic energy before the collision must be the kinetic energy after the collision
one half m one v one prime squared plus one half and two v two
prime squared this is my equation number one and this is my equation number two and
they can be solved you can solve them the assault in your book
i will simply give you the results because the result of very interesting to play what s that s what we ll be doing today
t one prime
will be n one minus m two
divided by n one plus n two
times v one
and v two prime
will be two n one divided by m one plus n two
times d one
the first thing that you already see right away
is that
v two prime is always in the same direction is v one that s completely obvious because
the second object was standing still remember
so if you plow something into the second object they re obviously continue in that direction that s clear
so you see you can never have a sign reversal here
key however you can have this sign reversal
if you bounce a ping pong ball of a billiard ball the ping pong ball will come back and this one becomes negative
whereas if you plow billiard ball onto a ping pong ball it will go forward
and so this can both be negative and can be positive depending upon
whether the upstairs is negative or positive so this is the result
which holds under three conditions that
the kinetic energy is concert so q is zero
that momentum is conserved and that v two before the collision equals zero
let s look at three interesting cases whereby we go to extremes
and let s first take the case that n one is much much larger than n two
and one is much much larger then them to another way of thinking about that is that that and to
go to zero extreme case the limiting case
so it s like having a bowling ball that you
collide with the ping pong ball
if you look at that equation
when n two goes to zero
this is zero this is zero notice that v one prime equals v one
that is completely intuitive
if a bowling ball collides with a ping pong ball the bowling ball and even see the ping pong ball it continues it s road is it nothing happened
that s exactly what you see after the collision the bowling ball continues on wolpert
what is v two prime
that is not so intuitive if you substitute in there
and two equals zero
then you get plus two v one
not obvious that all
plus two v one
it s not something you d want you to see i can see it meter i do a demonstration you can see that really happens so now you
take a bowling ball
and you call i to bowling ball with the ping pong ball and the ping pong ball
we ll get the velocity to v one
not more not less and boeing will continue with the same speed
now let s say okay okay so by n one
equals much much less than n two
in other words in the limit and k is m one goes to zero
and we substitute that in here
so
one goes to zero
so this is zero and so you see v one prime equals minus v one
v one prime equals minus v one come to the obvious
the pink the ball bounces of the bowling ball and adjust bounces back and this is what you see
and the bowling ball doesn t do anything because and one goes to zero two v two prime goes to zero
so that s very intuitive
and now we have a very cute case of m one equals n two
and when you substitute that in here but m one equals n two
v one prime becomes zero
so the further so one starts but v two prime becomes v one
if m one equals n two
you have to downstairs here into up stairs and you see that v two prime equals t one
and there s a remarkable case you ve all seen that you ll play with newton s cradle
you have two billiard balls
school in the other one bank thrown it
the first one stops and the second one takes off with the speed of the first an amazing thing
we ve all seen it i presume you have all seen it blows people do this
with pendulums went about things poles against each other i will do it here
with a model that you can see a little easier i have here billiard balls
and if i bounce this one on this one and we have case number three then you see this one standstill and this one
takes over the speed quite amazing
every time i see is a lot of it is a wonderful thing to see
nature just imagine you in nature
and this ball comes on
and in no time it ll have to solve these two equations very quickly there s only one solution
a nation knows how to do that this one stops and this one goes it s an amazing result
and i m sure that you have seen these pendulums that you can play with here we have
not a bowling ball on two ping pong ball but we have a
well you all the mass ratio is not infinity to one but this five hundred to one it s it s quite large
and so what i will first do is very into it if i will first bounce the ping pong ball off the bowling ball the billiard ball
the ping pong ball comes back almost with the same speed not quite
because ratios not infinity to one but it is five hundred to one and
the billiard ball will the practical and nothing is exactly what you see there in case to their ego
you see the ping pong ball comes back almost as far
as i let it go dell s unit the speed oh it the speech has not changed just bounces back
and the bill little almost of nothing now comes case number one that s a non intuitive case
it is intuitive that if the billiard ball hits the ping pong ball
that it will continue as you will see v one prime is the one with the same speed
it s not all intuitive that the ping pong ball will get twice the speed of the built a blend of course
you cannot see that quantitative because we don t woe quantitative measurements of the speed of the
pick them all but you will see
that it bounces of quite high so there we go
the billiard ball onto
the ping pong ball
look at the billiard ball alone forget the ping pong ball and try to see that the speed of the billiard ball
is practically unaffected by the collision that s what you see there
p one primus v one
is she s practically unaffected
now of course it is we harder to see that the ping pong ball
cats twice the speed of the billiard ball
abuse we don t do
because we don t do a quantitative measurements all right
so those were examples then of those three
possibilities that you all seen on the blackboard there
now i want to do more
completely elastic collisions and i m going to do that with the air track
i m going to try to make
completely elastic collisions that s not so easy
i i have one object standstill so always v two equals zero
and they re completely
the last of it
kinetic energy is conserved is were completely is not necessary always edited in my mind
i m going to have one object m one but
which i ve and against object and to an object and two will be spending he will have no speed object them one comes in from the site
and i ll try to make the collision
they lasted and away and we ll do that is by using springs which i attach to each mass and springs are
conservative forces solo there s almost no heat
that is generated in the springs during the collision
and so to a reasonable approximation you ll get
but elastic collision but of course there s always end wreck i can ever take and rec out
so there s always son external for an external force on the system
so momentum is never exactly conserved and kinetic energy
is never exactly conserved years so it s only an approximation
so i have one mass
of unit one i will tell you what that is
and i then that into number two
and the masses that i have one mass is two forty one
was a minus one m and the other mass that i have is for eighty two
was a minus one grams and i have
two of these and my first experiment i will use these two
so this is the ratio that you see one to one i will
vivid is certain velocity which i can not tell you what that is
that depends on how happy i feel if i push heart and the velocity will be high
if i push soft lead the velocity will be low but it is something
and then we re going to get here v one prime and there is a prediction
that is velocity would be zero
you call the way of the blackboard there
you will see the masses i the same
and as an elastic collision this one will stand still
and this one v two prime will have a velocity v one but that s a prediction
the second case i bounced one car on to another one which is twice the mass
certain velocity which i don t know what it is
and now what are we going to get so mass m one
is hot the mass of n two
so this is a one and this is a two and this is three
one minus two is minus one divided by three is minus one third
so number one comes back no surprise if you bounce
allied oil checked off a more massive object no surprise that it bounces back so that s minus one third
and when we look here we have two times one divided by one plus two which three that is plus two thirds
so number one will come back with the speed
one third which of course since is is sign sensitive we get one third v one
and this one is plus two thirds v one that s the prediction and the way we re going to measure right
this by measure the time for the objects to move over a distance of ten centimeters no matter how long
you see these course to be there is here a piece of metal which is ten centimeters long
it go through slot with and i don t we have one system here and one there
and you and this ten centimeter movement we measure the time we began
when this piece of metal enters the diet system and we stopped a time when it leaves the diver system and each one of those cars
has this ten centimeter metal plate
so the way we re going to do is is by measure time and of course this velocity
will give me a certain time
and this velocity will give me a certain time
whatever comes out you will see that on this time and then
t one crime
this in this case
it s standstill so must be zero
and t two prime
must be the same s t one so these two numbers you should be able to compare directly
what kind of uncertainty is do we have is hard to tell
but i would say as i ve argued last time that you should allow for at least about two and a half percent uncertainty in each time
if it comes out better than you re lucky if it comes out worse than it is a bat they
two and a half percent and argued last time how i reasons about the two and a half percent
now when do this experiment we get a certain q one
and so low this one goes back with
one third of the speed
so it will take three times longer to go ten centimeters so i m going to multiply this time
by one thirds
and whatever comes out should be the same as is so let me move this up a little
v two prime
the speed here
a forward speed is two thirds so it will go slower
so if i multiply this time by two thirds then
i should be able to compare with t one
and all that all these times i think will not be any better than roughly two and half percent
except
if we are little lucky
okay
system is up
done is erupt
i m is a this will be the time t one
this will be the time t
two prime
and this is the one when the object bounces back so it is here one prime
you won t see that it is negative
it will go back to the saints lot
and electronics is arrange in such a way that when it goes back to the same slot
ago initiate this time
i will zero m
first you have to tell me
but they re working i will just let it go through the slot this one working
the meter this one is working
if i send this one back
this one working right
okay well we go
is the one that will have no speed and this is the one that we re going to
give a boston
you re ready i ll you know what you re
see this one will come to a halt and this one will go on they have same as
and we go
it s one is indeed coming to a halt and this one to go over the speed what i d and numbers
one ninety four and one ninety six only two milliseconds different
that is an incredible result
oh point one nine for
and oh point one nine six so the one percent difference between
way within my while this expectations
because my expectations were that they could be off each by two and half percent
now we go to the one to two so here
is the car which has twice the mass
important that i zero it
and now this one
is going to come back
so you re going to see this one come in a few the time here
this one go through here if you the time here this one will come back issue time
i d is zero
okay
you ready
now
there we go
okay now
now comes the real acid test
one two three one eight six
one two three
and what is the last one three seven five
okay let me be lazy and let me use my calculator
three seven five
divided by three i could ve done that i want of course
this is oh point one two find an amazing agree
amazing only two percent off left and two percent now here oh point
one eight six times two divided by three
oh point one to four i can believe it
less than a percent off
so you see in front of the ice and we were able to create something
that was in the x to be close to
elastic collisions in spite of all the problems that we have ever had
and that of course there is always some laws off
kinetic energy but it s so little that it doesn t show up in these measurements
==========
now i want you to have a citizen i
i want you to think about the following
and if you can solve it before denied this over then
i really think you should lightweight
here s the wall
here is a tennis ball that comes in with a certain mass and
and it has a certain velocity v whatever that is
it s in the yearly elastic collision and it bounces back from the wall
and we all know that gives an inelastic collision
that it comes back with the same velocity
kinetic energy is conserved all the kinetic energy
is in the tennis ball nothing is in the wall the wall has an infinite large mass about
the momentum of this tennis ball has changed by an amount to m g
that momenta must be in the wall it s not the notion will because momentum must be conserved
so now here you see in front of your eyes a case that the wall has momentum but it has no kinetic energy can you
understand that can you reconcile that can you show me mathematically that that is completely kosher that the wall
has momentum two m v
someone on the notion whole it must have momentum and yet it has no kinetic energy how is that possible
think about it and if you can solve it call me a three a m and i ll tell you the solution okay now let s look
==========
at this from
the center of mass frame of reference the center of mass is very special
and this is is love to work
in the center of mass for reasons that you will understand
in the absence of any net external forces on a system as a whole as we discussed last time the center of mass
we ll always have the same velocity we did a demonstration there
with two vibrating object with the spring
but yet the center of mass was moving with a constant velocity
the d now is if you jump into the frame of the center of mass that means you move with the same velocity of the center of mass
the center of mass standstill in your frame of reference
and if the center of mass standstill the momentum
of the particles in your frame of reference in the center of mass frame of reference is zero
it is zero before to conditions
that is zero after the collisions and this gives the center of mass some amazing properties that i will
discuss with you know first we have a particle and one
and we have a particle and two
and let this one
in the center of mass frame
had a velocity you one
and this in the center of mass from has a velocity you too
i give it specifically use so that you can separate
the use from the things the visa always indoor frame of reference the use i in
the frame of reference of the center of mass and i take a case whereby i have a completely
elastic collision that means q is zero the kind that we have just discussed
momenta and is not only concern but it is also zero
at all moments in time before and after the collision
after the collision let s say them to goes back with velocity
you to prime and that s a and one
has a velocity
you one crime
that s the situation after the collision
now i know that momentum is zero
so can i can hear i i would he can write down for the situation after the collision that and one
times mu one prime plus n two
times you to prime must be zero
i don t write them down as vectors that s not necessary because it to one dimensional collision
and the signs will automatically take care
of the directions
i told you i chose the case of a completely
elastic addition q is zero and so no kinetic energy must be conserved
so i have before the collision i have one pop and one you one squared plus one half
them to you too squared
and after the collision i have one hot them one
you one prime square it was one half and two
you too i m scraped kinetic energy before kinetic energy afterwards equate one equation two
nature can solve that quicker than we can and the result is amazing
the results in the center of mass
is that you one prime
equals minus u one and you to crime
equals minus u two
and that is an amazing result when you think about it it means that in the center of mass
all that happens if that the speed to reverse directions
but the speed the velocity is weaver directions but the speeds remain the same and that is a remarkable
the remarkable was so
if you ever want to
move yourself to the center of mass you have to know what the center of mass velocity is
how to b calculate the velocity of the center of mass
so we use in here with the center of mass frame
and now i m going back to the board which
and we know that and total
times the position vector of the center of mass of the way to find the last time equals m one
times the position vector of particle one plus n two
time and position vector of particle two and so if you take the derivative of this equation
then the positions become velocity is so the velocity of the center of mass equals one
divided by n one plus n two
because that s the and total which i bring under here in upstate as i get them one v one
two plus m two v two
and notice i left the arrows off because since it s a one dimensional problem signs will take care
of the directions
so this is the velocity of the center of mass
i wrote also there on the blackboard because later on in this lecture i will need it
and it is possible that by that time i have arrays it and so that s why i voted on there too
so if now you want to know what you
nice so we are
now you want to know what the velocity is in the center of mass frame that of course
equals v one minus
the velocity of the center of mass and you two equals v two
minus the velocity of the center will mine
so this is a way that you can transfer if you want to
into the center of mass frame
and a son i m space off for reasons that i mentioned
that the momentum in the center of mass frame is zero
always zero before the collision and after the collision independent of whether it is an elastic collision but it s an inelastic collision
or whether it s a super elastic collision
now if you later wanted to transform back to your laboratory from
then of course you ll have to add the velocity of the center of mass again to the you one prime
and you have to at the velocities center of mass to the u two prime
the velocity of the center of mass has not changed
as seen from your frame of reference
because of a lot of center of mass is always the same remember because momentum is conserved
so to get into the center of mass frame you must subtract
the velocity of the center of mass from the initial velocities to get out of it
you must atom
==========
now the kinetic energy and the momentum depend on you re reference frame
in general the total momentum as seen from your seat is not zero that s only in a very special case
in case of the center of mass the total momentum is always zero
the kinetic energy as seen from the lab frame is certainly in general not the same as the kinetic energy from
the center of mass frame and now comes another unique property off the center of mass
if i have a completely inelastic collision
then all energy in the center of mass frame is lost
that s obvious in the center of mass frame remember
momentum is zero so you re in the center of mass one particle comes to you and the other comes to you
you re not moving you in the center of mass they get stuck together
because it s a completely an elastic collision if they get stuck together
after the collision they stand still
that means all kinetic energy that was there before is all the short and this kinetic energy
as observed in the center of mass frame we call the aim turn all energy
and there there is the maximum energy in the collision that can ever be converted into heat
and i will show oh that to you
partially i will do some of the work and i will that you do some of the work as well
so i will first calculate
in your frame of reference when you re sitting
how much energy is lost
when we have a completely inelastic collision
i will then transfer to the center of mass frame
and i will show you then this quite amazing property
so now we are back in twenty six one hundred and we re going to make a completely
inelastic
collision that means they stick together remember and and to
we will have again to make life a little simple know speed
v two equals zero and and one
has a velocity v one you ve seen is now resilient times they get together the stick together
and so i have here a velocity which i call b prime
and the masses m one plus m two
just after the collision
momentum is conserved if there s no external net external force on the system and so i can write down that m one v one
must be and one plus n two times v prime and so v prime
equals m one v one divided by m one plus two
that s a very simple calculation
this by the way it is not so obvious is also so all the velocity of the center of mass
and how can i see that so quickly well
what was the velocity of the center of mass
here you had it this was in general
this was not for the case that v two was zero it was more general make v two zero and you see exactly that
you see here the same result so this must be the velocity
of the center of mass
now how we can calculate what the difference is
between the potential energy the kinetic energy after the collision and kinetic energy before the collision
that is of course something that is brought a trivial you know
what the kinetic energies before the collision it s one half m one v one squared
and you know what it is i after the collision i calculated v prime
and so have to take off this mass multiply it by d is velocity is quit you can do that i m sure you can do that
and you ll be able to see that this equals minus you have to recycle to buy little bit minus one half
and one and two divided by n one plus n two
times the e one squared that s what you will find the minus sign
is predictable we loose kinetic energy when there isn t completely inelastic collision we ve done many last lecture
you lose kinetic energy we solid and every single case that s what the minus sign beans
this is q
you lose kinetic energy and that goes into heat so you re on your homework now
in the laboratory frame and you are home free very well
now i m going to do the same calculation in the center of mass right
and i will show you now that s the purpose that this amount of energy
which is what is lost
that that is all that lost to start with in the center of mass m and that s the unique property of the center of mass
and so i m going to convert now
transfer you to the center of mass from and then we will calculate how much energy
there was in the center of mass frame
before the collision because after the collision there is nothing is zero
in case of a complete the inelastic collision
there s no kinetic energy left in the center of mass for
so we don t the center of mass frame
so it first have to calculate what you bounce well you one
equals v one minus the center of mass
and we know the center of mass is is right there
that s right it s
and if you do to subtraction achieved by no means difficult you will find n two
divided by m one plus n two times v one
and you check that i hope and now we go to calculate you to you want to know what the
velocity is the center of mass the other one that of course is v two
minus the center of mass but this was zero is m one
divided by m one plus n two
times the one so the difference is only d m one upstairs and the end too
now we re going to calculate the kinetic energy
in the center of mass right
well that equals one half
of m one times
you one squared plus one half and two
times you two squared that s all we have before the collision will curse
uh whether way this is not the mind is is a plus sign and this is a minus sign this one comes this way
and this one goes in that way now i can i can calculate that for you you know you
you know you too
i suppose oh my that s i make a difference because they cancel anyhow what you going to find one half and one
and two divided by m one plus n two times
v one square
and this was exactly the same that we had there and so what you see here
if you allow me for having skip some steps and algebra
you will have to do a little miss i she to get from here to here
you see here this is the kinetic energy before the collision and all that kinetic energy east
remove it went to p
is the maximum you can ever lose and this is what we call the internal kinetic energy of this is
so going to the center of mass system you can always immediately
calculate what the maximum d t s but you can expect from a collision
we can take a very special case
and we can take them to
going to infinity if like having a piece of funny and i slept on the wall you get stuck and was
the maximum heat that you can
produced that s all the energy there is if n two becomes infinitely high then
and one can be ignored and to cancel than to you get one half and v
m one v one squared and that s obvious
that s completely trivial i have a piece of putty
as slanted against the wall it has a certain amount of kinetic energy whether you see the you re reference frame
or in the reference frame of the center of mass it s immediately obvious
that all the kinetic energy is lost and that s exactly what you see
comes out of these equations whether you go to the center of mass or whether you do it from twenty six one and
i now would like to return to the air track and do
several completely inelastic collisions with you began
we have to assume that the momentum is conserved
it never is completely but we can come close
and we will
i have two cars that
no we re going to because now completely inelastic
completely inelastic
so they in each other and they get stuck
i get a certain velocity which i put into the first car it s
it s the second car and it gets stuck
and i see there what my v prime is
i see there on the blackboard
and if the two are the same at one here
i one and a one here is that the ratio so the outcome is and v prime this be one half v one
so this must be one half v one
now i have a mass which is half the other one
i plug it into the other they get stuck together and now i get one
divided by one plus two i get
one third noticed in both cases i get a plus sign
that s of course obvious if i go into something and they stick together they continue in the same direction
and so no i will do the timing in exactly the same way that i did before except that now i
haven t completely inelastic addition
we ll have a time t one
and i wasn t i mean the prime
the cars have a slightly different mass to thirty seven
the minus one brand and have one that is four hundred and seventy four
plus minus one brain not too different from this i have
two of these contests and i have one of these
and first i m going to slam
the stew on to each other
and so when they collide i expect the speech to be hot so i get a certain amount of
t one so t one the time will be
twice as long because the speed goes down by a factor of two so when i multiply
is number by one half
i would like to get as you move back he i get the time for this car
the first want to come in because me a certain time
when they continue together speed is three times war
so this time will be three times higher
so i multiply this by one
and i would like to get that i m back
and those are the two experiments
that i would like to do now so we have to getting always back on
metric one
right too
he we have the two because they have a valve crowe
so when they hit each other they get stuck sometimes would bounce actually i have a good experiment then
this one goes here
is one goes here i d is to time is on
we don t eat this time anymore either ozone
zero then
zero then my the zero
okay you ready this one is
plow into this one the merge and they continue and then you see
the time he prime here there we go then
alright what is the
one create to eight a
one three eight to eight eight
one the eight
two eight eight divided by two oh point one four four
that is the different is only six and that is only
four percent on that completely within my prediction that each time could be off by two and a half percent
now i will have a car
which is twice the mass
and this is one the mass
i will set them again zero and now we get one on to double the mass
ready
we go
ah you see the month
they did in fact
we ll have to start over
they don t think of course that it s
well and completely inelastic collision that window
and made a slight bounds which i didn t like let s see would be get can always do it again
one six eight five for five
one six eight
multiply this by three
five a love for five for five
eight percent difference is a little high
but the things can happen i told you did bounced i d like that
and then they got stuck again i will do it once more
maybe have a little bit lucky
and i bounced a little before they finally emerged
six o three one eighty seven
one eight seven
six oh three if i divide this by three i get oh point two oh one and that is off again
by about thirty units about seven percent different and so it s a little bit more than five percent but i ll
==========
to make it worse for you to night i would like you to think about something else
not only about the tennis ball against the
wall whereby the wall has momentum but no kinetic energy
but now i would like you to think about this amazing thing i have eights billiard balls here in your
newton s cradle probably also have eight balls hanging from pendulums this is easy you to demonstrate a twenty six one hum
now i that to malls bang onto the other six
antinode you predict what s going to happen in your prediction is correct
if you slant two balls on to the six
nature is going to calculate like mad to conserve momentum to conserve kinetic energy
closely enough to completely elastic collision and outcomes at the only way that nature can do it is the following
there all standstill and these to takeoff look again
all standstill and these to take off that s not an easy calculation but now look at the following poland
what happens if i take three
and i days three on the others five
what you predict this going to happen
how many will take off
three you think you sure
you are right okay now five
five on three there s a tough problem even for nature
what you think will happen
i go again and three will say you re good
if anyone you can show me analytically that this is what has to happen i would love to see those results okay
so you wednesday
