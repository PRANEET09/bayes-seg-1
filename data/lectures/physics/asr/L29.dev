==========
you see here the topics that go your plate on monday
clearly not possible for me and one exam to cover all these topics so i have to make a choice monday
today also have to make a choice i cannot do just this to all these topics
in any depth oh i will but a fly over the
in some of them i won t even touch at all
oh where what is not covered today may well be on the exam
you ll get loads of equations almost every equation that i could think off will be on your exam
there s also a special tutoring this weekends you contract that on the web saturday and sunday
let s start with them
completely inelastic collision
completely inelastic collected
we have mass m one
we ve mass m two
so one dimensional problem
this one has velocity v one
and this has velocity v two they collide and after the collision they are together
because that s what it means when the collision is completely inelastic and they have a velocity v prime
if there is no net external force on the system
momentum must be conserved
so i now have put them one
t one plus and two v two must be m one plus m two
times a b prime one equation with one unknown v prime follows immediately
you may say gee
you should really have put arrows over here
well in the case that is one dimensional collision you can leave the air was off
because the signs automatically take care of that
kinetic energy is not conserved
before the collision
you kinetic energy
equals one half
m one v one squared plus one half and two v two squared
after the collision
kinetic energy equals one half
m one plus m two
times of the crimes squared and you can easily proof
that this is always less than that
in case of a completely inelastic collision is always kinetic energy the street
which then comes out in the form of heat
let s do now a elastic collision
and i at the words completely leslie but elastic itself
is enough because that means that kinetic energy is conserved
i start with the same initial condition
and one the one m two v two but now
after the collision
and one
could either go this way with this way i don t know
so this could be v one prime is could be v one prime
and two however
will always go into this direction
that s clear because if you get it from behind by object one
after the collision your obviously go in this direction
again we don t have to put the air rose over it because the signs take care of it into one dimensional case
this will be plus then that could be you could adopt that you convention
and if it goes in this direction that will be negative so if you find for v one prime minus something it means
it s bounce back so now we can apply the conservation
i ll for momentum if there is no external force on the system internal forces this phi i m woods
oh light through now we have them one d and
plus m two v two equals m one v one prime present ooh
v two prime conservation of momentum
no we get the conservation of kinetic energy because we note unless the collision one half m one and
d one squared one half and two
v two squared that s before the collision after the collision one half
m one v one prime squared plus one half
and two v two prime squared
two equations with two and owns and in principle you can solve for v one prime and for v two prime
except that it could be time consuming
and so on eggs m s would is normally downwind you get a problem like that
no water you get a problem we ll hear them and it s made them to all them on
these boat from water is of n m two
or them on is much much of that and to like get
to all two ping
or ping pong ball to ask to do very
symbol x and when i i will take now for you and wall equals n two
and i will call that and
and i would even simplified problem
by making v two zero so the second object is standing still
men journal collision it s that object very special case
so cons a
of momentum not becomes motor and and and times v on
this know v two equals m v one prime plus n v two prime
conservation all kinetic energy
is one half and
v one squared
the colts one half and the v one prime squared plus one half m
v two prime squared
oh is that no i lose my hands which is very come the kids here i lose my one half and see even
this is very easy to solve
if you scan this occur asian
you got something you look very similar to this if you square it
you get v one squared equals
v one prime squared
plus v two prime squared plus two v one prime v two prime
and compare this equation with this equation almost identical except for this term so this term must be zero
but we know that z two prime is not zero get text and so it ll go for word
so what it means that is that v one prime equals o
and if v one prime equals zero you see that v two prime equals v one and this is that classic case
when i uh
it s another all the the small on is no speed
it it s it with this so the velocity v one they have the same mass
the the collision this one standstill and this one pick so with the speed famous newton s cradle is c is often
with pendulums it is the low go on the eight oh one home page and i showed you a demonstration here
when we discussed that in lectures
==========
oh that s move and let s do something now own
its angular momentum
rotation
and less two s is because the end would machine
atwood machine
the primitive is that ll as you to measure to reasonable degree of accuracy the gravitational acceleration
here s a pouring the pulley has mass and has radius r it s so late
so two solid disk
it s frictionless a point p
radius r
and there is a rope here near massless
we cure to mass mass m two is here
and mass m one is here
and let s assume that m two is larger than n one
for this will be accelerated in this direction
this will be accelerated in this direction and this will start to rotate
with angular velocity omega which will be a function of time
and the first thing we want to do is to make up
pre ball the diagrams pre what you know i get for this one is easy
m one g that
and t one up for this we have
and two g down
and we have
t two up
the pulley so little bit more complicated
is that point p
if here s a tension t one that s putting that in the putting
so this is t one
and these t two with putting on the pudding
there s t two
it has a mass so it is
weight m g this
forces on the pudding be zero go to the wood accelerate itself
on which it doesn t and so low that has to be
the force up i will call it and and that force n
has to cancel all these three four six so that must be t one plus e two plus m g
we will not needed any further in our calculations but that has to be if forced to hold that in place so to
to
we re
calculate the acceleration under the condition that the rope does not slip
that means there is friction with the pulley no friction here it here otherwise the road would slip the rope will slip
what it means if there is no no slip that if the movie on centimeter
that the we ll also turned that this circumference one centimeter that s what it means when there is no slip
that means the whole city of the o d of all our
v of the rule
must be omega times r of the pulley that s what no slip means
so the acceleration which is the derivative of that velocity of the rope a
is omega times all or
which is often times r
oh me guys the angular velocity
and phi is the angular acceleration the bases the condition is important condition for no slip
so let s start at object to below and and write down newton s second law
i call this the of the direction for object
and i call this the positive direction for object to just easier for me
so we get the wall on it is and one g must be m one eight
no equation i don t know what here on it s i don t know what days
so in the equation for this one i call this the positive direction m two g
minus t two must the
and to a second equation
we and and no it has be had it so i need or
of course any more i also have to think about the pudding
the pulley and
force on the pulley is zero that s why
this space and planes but it s going to rotate because this force t two is larger than this p one
there is a poor quality of to that point p and tore work with the finite and as our
for was f but it relative to point p
the metal attitude
is this position vector and i m this force
that is a torque in but it s what is in the blackboards i will call positive
the work to to this force is the blackboard and i will call that negative
since this angle is ninety degrees
i simply get that the towrope relative to point p
equal of the radius of this cylinder
the radius of that putting times t two
that s the positive part in the negative part is the radius
times t one
is that this course and this course go through p to contribute a the torque
and and you can also the moment of inertia of at that point p times all all fine
but since we have no no slip
all of ice a divided by r
so what s them mud of inertia about point p
times a divided by r
but since it is a rotating disk
which is rotating about its center of mass
i know what a moment of inertia i end up if you read it
during your exam you will find that in the x and that is one half m r squared one half m
r squared times e divided by r and and lose one r
and so i find then that t two
this t one equals one half and they know what is i also lose my second are
and so no i have a thirty equation
and i can solve forty two i can so for t one and i can solve for a
and you can do that as well as i can
if you re on the results you should always do a little bit of testing to make sure that you result make sense
and what you should do is you should say a
wish it d make sure that
and two g
is a jerk then and t two that s them us otherwise it s not being accelerated down
you should also checked that t y on comes out a larger than m one g that s also most
and you should also check that t two wheel larger than t one otherwise the put a wooden rotate clockwise direction
it would all also be useful which is a trivial check
reduce there sticking your results am on equals m two that should give you that
the acceleration to be zero and it to give you the t one equals t two
those are these things and it can be done very simple it take you know more than ten seconds
and if it s any all on of these is not met and somewhere
you slip up it gives you an opportunity
to go over the problem again
==========
all right let s now do another problem
simple harmonic oscillations a physical pendulum
i have here
for their mass and length l rotating here
about an axis perpendicular to the blackboard without friction here s the center of the rod
and let this angle
b theta
though is it
let if two points p
there s also works that go through point p i m not even interest in the net force are know what it is here
and jay did i m going to take the torque relative to point p
i don t worry about the force but that has to be a fourth to point b i s this
there would be x rated um hum
with acceleration g if this is the only force that were
but we know that s not the case is going to sweep so that has to be forced to p i don t
know what it is but has to be one
so the tall work relative to point p
the magnitude is the position vector r
of p from here to here cross with this
or so and so that makes it one half l
now is m g
i m this i i know the angle
and that s the angle is theta and so that is times the sine
of theta the west worked as the sine of the angle in
but is it so that if two point p which also must be an auto sure
a ball at point p times all all fine
no difference from what we just had with the pulley so
because omega know out is also
faded oh we ll got this omega
these the angular velocity
it d theta d t
and the derivative is me the angular acceleration
that s a b and n assign here that s important because the torque is least in
the ink situation we had when we had us and we all oscillating the spring
the spring force is my line is k x minus sign here
pace exactly the same rule
so i can i don t hear mall i d is i of p
faded doubled but
know if we take a small angle approximation
small angle
approximation then the sine of theta
is approximately theta if theta is in radians
and so i can replace now the sine of theta here by theta
and so now i find it very bring this to the other so i get fate out double dots
plus one half l
and g divided by the moment of inertia about point p time theta
equals zero needless to say that i i m happy like a clamp that height oh i d
because i see here an equation which clearly tells me that we have the simple harmonic
estimation faded oval but
plus a constant times theta is zero
and so we must get there s a solution that theta
must be some maximum angle
times the cosine of omega t plus or minus phi
and the omega as them
thing to do with that omega this is the angular
frequency
this is related to the period t of the oscillation which is two pi divided by omega this is a constant
there s oh may guys not a constant
it is unfortunate in physics that we use the same symbol
the angular over us a t is zero and the objects standstill is a maximum and the effect is here
that omega is always the same is related to how long it takes to make one oscillations
called omega radians per second couldn t be more confusing
alright if we if lines of p then we can show all for the frequency
angular frequency and we can solve for the periods
so let s do the
calculate the moment of inertia about point p
in order to do that we have to apply the parallel axis theorem
because you probably be given
the moment of inertia for rotation about the axis through the center of mass parallel to this axis
and that and you have to add the mass
times the distance between these two axes squared to apply the parallel axis theorem
so this is the moment of inertia about the center of mass plus m
times the distance squared and the distance between these two axes is one half l
so this is one order
l squared
i look into table what the moment of inertia is for rotation of a rod about its center
perpendicular wrought is perpendicular to the x is and that is one twelve m l squared
plus one quarter m l squared
if the one third of an l squared
so i know without of peace and so now i can solve for d
value for omega the angular frequency
uh do that here so that we keep everything on the blackboard
so the storrow here which is all may guess squared
omega squared equals one half l and
gee the it d by one third and
l squared i lose one l
i lose one then very calm and always lose your hands in gravity
and so this is three hass d divided by l
and so the period of oscillation is to like
the fall i to die obey got omega is the square root of this so that becomes the square root
of two thirds l over g
and that is the period
of the oscillation of this rule a we
work on something similar elections
and we even measured the period and we found very very good agreement with the
theoretical prediction
could i asked is the kinetic energy of rotation of this wrote which changes with start
kinetic energy of rotation
is them on how i i omega squared
remember the the near kinetic energy is one half
m v squared
the hand becomes all right you go to rotation and v becomes omega
so the kinetic energy of rotation
equals one half i omega squared to find this equation on your exam
this is i about that point p
you know with a is as a function of time so omega
equals b theta d t
so you can find that omega is
you know what i if p is we just calculated it and so you know what the kinetic energy of rotation is at any moment in time
it will change it will be zero when this comes to
and it will be a maximum when it is here
it s a continuous conversion from gravitational potential energy is a maximum here
to kinetic energy
which is a maximum here
and so this will obviously change with final kinetic energy of rotation
i thought problem eight why wasn t nice eggs on all all how to apply
==========
kepler small awesome newtons what all s of gravity in the case that we have
but elliptical orbit
here we have a a planet mass m
radius r is not rotating that has no atmosphere
grants you a little bit artificial
we ll on to settle right
the and the settle light
gets in velocity here which was called v zero
as it is right here at the surface and this angle twenty degrees and we were told
that the point
artist away was life planets radii away so oh
if i try to sketch the elliptical orbits assuming
that the velocity is instantaneously reach that mean this point must
also be a point of the orbit
if i try to make a sketch then that elliptical orbits
would look something like this
something like this
and then this distance is five are
i call this point a
that it poured that is farthest away from the center it s clear that the satellite will crash back onto the planet
but that s no concern to us
what i draw this ellipse i made the assumption that
well and as of the planet was in so i d the ellipse for instance somewhere here oh that is not the case
so only this part of the ellipse
israel mistake and this part of course it s not
which you being asked
is to calculate what v zero was only based on the information of the five are in the twenty degrees and on the mass
and i can add to it
what is the velocity here and a when it is farthest the way
and i can even at to it
what is the semimajor axis where this is to a all that
comes for free with that
initial condition and and it s that it goes out five planet radii
the angular momentum l
equals r cross p
angular momentum is conserved for this object in orbit
mass little hand but only if you take the angular momentum relative to this point
i don t know what i call this point
looks like i call the p
i can t hardly read i call it see for now
so and momentum of this object in this orbit
isn t
conserve relative to any point it s only conserve relative to this point
so we end momentum relative to point c at this moment in time
is the position vector which is capital r r times the velocity but
i have two multiplied by the sine of twenty degrees
so it s them is
and v right so we get a v zero here be get a capital r here and we get the sine
of twenty to guns
our times indeed
that must also be the angular momentum
right here in the fact that and you know men to be is in the blackboards is no concern to be i just want to know the magnitudes
when the only because here the angular momentum
is the position vector which is lengths five are
the velocity is v of a but the angle is now ninety degrees so the sine of the angle is one
so i get n times v a
times five are
i lose my little n and i have one equation with two unknowns i don t know what v zero is
and i don t what your praise and either another equation
well these are conservative forces we dealing with gravity so oh mechanical energy must be conserved
or what we use to use to say the low energy of this system is conserved
but energy of this system is kinetic energy plus potential energy
be conserved must be the same here is it is there
what is the total energy here the kinetic energy is one heart then v zero squared
what is the potential energy here
this line this them
and g divided by its distance to the center which is capital r
that is the total energy right here
the total energy here could not have changed must therefore be one half m v a squared
my interest and andy but know the distance equals i r
from the fact that i lose my little and
no is i have a second equation i didn t at any unknowns
so i have two equations with two unknowns v zero and v you ve a
and you can solve for that you can find interesting you know if
you can also find the semimajor axis because the total energy of the system is also minus m and g e
divided i to a this equation is also on your exam
and so if you know v zero or you know v a
then you can the m cancels and you can also calculate the semi major axis
==========
okay
was shifts
the letter something about doppler shift
the worst push of
of electromagnetic radiation light rate waves x rays
there is this are moving relative to us
with the ball s a t v
since we re dealing with
electromagnetic radiation we don t have to ask whether this r a s moving relative to us
we re moving relative to the star that question is a meaningless question in special relativity
your here
you are east seat in the frequency f prime
and here is that s star or
and that star is moving with a certain velocity
let s say this velocity v
and this angle is theta
so this component of the velocity in our direction
is v cosine theta we call that the radial component
and whether the star is moving to us
oh we to the star makes no difference
if the velocity of the star is much much smaller than see then
f prime the one that you will receive equals f times one plus
the value over c times the cosine of theta is equation is on your exam see
is three times ten to the fixed kilometers per second
if cosine theta is positive the object is approaching
and you observe i the frequency
cosine vegas negative the object is going away the radial component is away from us and the frequency is lower
in optical astronomy we cannot measure of frequencies we can only measure wavelength and the connection between
wavelength and frequency lamb des
equals the speed of light divided by the frequency
so we can substitute in that equation
f equals c divided by y and a and f prime
e equals c divided by dammed up right
when we do that and we also make use of this approximation
that one divided by one plus x
is approximately one minus x
as low as x is much much smaller than one
this is the first order term in detail expansion
there you can find that now am the prime becomes lamb des
times one minus comes a minus sign the plus changes to minus sign for that reason
times v divided by c times cosine theta
notice that here you have that radial velocity and you have that here
you have a prime
is larger than level on the object is going away from us we call that red shift
the object is receding
alam deprived is less than wavelength of red than an actual them back we call the blue shift
because the wavelengths become shorter in this time move source the blue end of the spectrum here becomes larger
sits to the rat part of the spectrum
the blue shift means the object is approaching you
during an accident be discussed this we took an example well am the prime over land
it was one point zero zero three three three
if you substitute that in this equation you will find that v cosine theta
equals minus one hundred
kilometers per second
so that means all you know is the radial velocity you never get any information about the angle
that the radial velocities hundred kilometers per second away from us or
we re moving hundred kilometers per second away from the star that s the same thing in
special relativity
if we apply this to sound then we get there very similar equation
suppose you sit still and twenty six one hundred and i move a sound source to you
but you don t move
then you get the similar equation that f prime is the frequency that you will hear equals f
times one plus v over the sound times the cosine of theta and sound speed
is about three hundred forty meters per second
at room temperature
in other words if i tore all something around in a circle
and you are in the plano that circle you here
and when the object comes to you
you hear maximum the frequency f prime is larger than f
when it goes away from you
you hear a decrease in frequency
smaller then f and when the object is here and when it is here
when the angle is ninety degrees and the cosine theta is zero
you ll find f prime equals f
f prime equals f
so what earl something around let s suppose i taught it around with a
orbital velocity if i call that orbital velocities
of three point four meters per second use to get some nice numbers then this is point oh one
and so if it comes to you you increase of one percent in the frequency when it goes away from you you hear a decrease
of one percent i have here
a sound source which produces roughly fifteen hundred hertz
i control it around
i can do it once per second around with and if you re even twice this speed and so he would here
but two percent increase when it comes to you
the percent increase when it goes away from you
immediate a doppler shift
always a good intellectual oh because you get reflections from the wall
and they re in when it comes to you that the pictures higher than when it goes away from you
==========
okay
road objects let s roll something down the hill
classic problem very often you see that on exams
we take a ball and we wrote it down an inclined
is a decline in the angle is beta
here is the ball the sphere
it s a solid sphere has mass m and radius r
and it is solid
this is the center
of that ball i call this point p
i put all the force is some that i can think if there is m g here
at this point be the normal force from the surface and there is friction
this is the frictional force the sum of f f
and the normal force is what we call the contact force that is the force with which
the inclined pushes back onto the ball that we normally decompose that
in the direction along the slope and perpendicular to this well
so these are the only three forces that is object is experiencing
and i can ask you know what it s a the acceleration which it
goes down the slope and i can ask you what is the frictional force
i will last two that under the conditions of pure oh
what is your on the and
it means that if this this circumference here moves one centimeter
that the center of mass has also move one centimeter so it means that the velocity of the center
so this velocity
deal c at all moments in time
will be only go are omega is the angular velocity which is changing with time
that is the condition of pure role
at all moments in time if i have a rotating sphere or cylinder
always will this circumference
speed be omega are it could be standing still and is rotating like this something like al and not moving forward
then the circle influential speed is always omega are but
if the center also moves with that same speed only then do we call it you roll
you take the derivative of this you get a
equals omega dot times are that equals off or
oh for being the angular acceleration
all right we re going to write down now
the torque relative to that point c
if i take point c then i lose the force n g
and reduce the force n so was only one force that i have to deal with so the torque
but if two points see
the fact that the torque is in the blackboard so no concern to me i just want a know the magnitude that is are
times f f r times the frictional force
that must be the moment of inertia about that point p about that point c times all fire which scene is now twice really
and so since all phrase a divided by r is is i ll see times a b divided by r
this is one equation
and i have a as an unknown and i have f f as an unknown there s not enough anymore
newton s second law always holds the center of mass
for the center of mass it was always holds that f equals m a
so all i do know a little the center of mass and i say y to force is which are acting down the slope i m not interest it
in the ones perpendicular to the slope only the ones down the slope
that must be m a it s not the notion will begin that is a quality characteristic of the center of mass well
this one is up until
and the only one that is downhill is the component of n g along the slope which is n g sine beta
i call that the plus direction so i get n g sine beta
minus that frictional force
equals n
times a my second equation i ve two equations was
torn owns and i can solve a is an unknown
and the frictional force is an unknown you can do that as well as i can
i will just give you the results i d
waste your time on the altar prime
a knee acceleration under the conditions of pure all the only under the conditions of to roll
equals n r squared times d
times the sine of beta
divided by m r squared plus
the moment of inertia about that points see
and the frictional force
you can see that from this equation
is the moment of inertia times a divided by r squared and i will leave a as it is because it becomes too complicated otherwise
and so the the frictional force becomes the moment of inertia about c times a
divided by r squared
so this a has to be substituted in here
the acceleration is independent of the mass and independent of the radius
very non intuitive doesn t matter whether you take a ball this bake or this make doesn t matter what the masses
the reason for that is that as you will see shortly that the moment of inertia
also contains a term m r squared
and so all the them are squares will disappear
let s first take a look at
beta are related to a a notice when beta equals zero that a
equals zero it definitely
if there is no slope there cannot be any acceleration
notice if a equals zero that the frictional force is also zero it better be
so that is an easy checked it you can do
internal inconsistency check
so let s now look at
i ll see what is i ll see i look it up in the table a ball
see here rotating about an axis through the center of mass
so one of the few that i happen to remember is to fix and r squared
if i substitute that in here
i find that the acceleration under the conditions of pure role is five seven
g times the sine
of beta
and i find that the frictional force
f of f
equals two seven is i believe times n g sine beta in the in the
is are the results by substituting the moment of inertia in there
let s look at these results a little closer
if there were no friction
then we know
that the acceleration would it be in g sine beta
remember that is sliding object
but no friction would be g sine beta why is it now lower
five seventy is lower than one
it s obvious because when is object comes rolling down
the kinetic energy of the total kinetic energy
this kinetic energy of rotation
plus the linear portion of the kinetic energy
the forward motion to to this one half m v squared
when you have a sliding object there is only the linear component there s no rotational kinetic energy so now
the linear kinetic energy must be low or
because some gravitational potential energy
goes into rotational kinetic energy and so it must go slower and so the acceleration must be less it s completely to it of
that it is less than g sine beta
let s look at the frictional force
this is a situation
of two oh we know that the
friction force can never exceed the maximum value possible
that is a no no
if the frictional force becomes the maximum one it would start to sit
there would no longer beep your role
in other words there is it necessary condition that the frictional force
which is a two seventh and g
sine beta must be less then the maximum frictional force
but the maximum frictional force is mu s
static friction coefficients times this value and and this value n is n g cosine theta
beta and so this is u s times n d
go oh sine beta i lose my n g
no surprise and so a necessary condition is
that this static friction coefficient must be larger than two seven
times it engine
of all find in order to have
purely
snowball fight i don t know what is wrong which the data
and this of course is pleasing in a way
because what this is telling you when we all know that by our instinct you feel that your stomach
that if you make the angle too large
if you tell that there s no way to you
get you a rope it will start rowing of course with also start slippery
for instance if your freeze the friction coefficient
and you say the friction coefficient is oh point two
then it means that beta be angle beta must be less than thirty five degrees that just an example
so that s intuitively pleasing
remember that during one of the lecture sweet calculate it the
period of oscillation
of an object that was sliding on an air track without friction
and it wasn t curve of the circle and huge radius
with hundreds of meters and we had a sliding object here and that will sliding without friction
and we derived that the period was two pi times the square root of r divided by g
as if this were pendulum with length r
and that s in fact what it is
we did that with the air track
and the results were fantastic in agreement with our prediction
an unbelievable accuracy
and then we did it with a
smaller radius with a ball rolling balls this one
the radius of that curvature was eighty five centimeters
and we predicted the periods of one point eight five seconds
this equation
and we measured it and what did we finds way higher
we observe something like
i think two point three seconds
and i asked you at the end of the lecture why
and some of you said well the radius is small that was no reason
because the angle the displacement angle will still very small
this maximum angle theta maximum
will so small that that could never explained by the period was so much larger but now you know
because when this object were all down
the kinetic energy is partially in the linear term
and partially in rotation
partially in the near term and partially in rotation into this line in in his all in the linear term
so it clearly goes faster know it has to share with the rotation and so that s the reason by we found a higher period
and that s precisely the situation that you have you
i
repeat
that this is what you have on your plate a monday
there is no way that i can cover all of that during one exam please hold its we one minute left
there s no way i can cover all of that
during one exam i ll have to make a choice
i will pick only if you
miracle record today at any get all these topics
the ones that i did not cover doesn t even all the you will not sitting on the exam
there s a special tutoring scandal this week and that you can make use off
and i believe that is a lecture will be on pivots to more warning
and with you luck and i see them and they
