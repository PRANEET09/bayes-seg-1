==========
today i will talk to you about
elliptical orbits and
kepler s famous walls i first want to
review with your briefly what we know about circular orbits
so i wrote on the blackboard there everything we know about circular orbit is an object mass little m
going in a circle around capital and this could be the sun that could be the earth has radius r circular
we know they re equation one how to derive the time that it takes to go around the way we
found that was biased adding the centripetal force on two little them the same as the gravitational force also the
velocity in orbit maybe i should say speed in orbit also if follows
three same kind of reasoning
then we have the conservation of mechanical energy
the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy
is a constant is not changing
you see there first the component of the kinetic energy which is the one half m v squared
and then you see the term which is the potential energy
we have defined potential energy to be zero at infinity
and that is why all bound orbits have negative total energy
if the total energy is positive you orbit is not about
and when you add these two well up
you have amazing coincidence that we ve discussed before you get here a very simple answer
the escape velocity you find
by setting this e total to be zero
so this part of the equation is zero
oh tops that speed which which you
skate the gravitational pull of capital m
which is square root of two times larger than the speed
and i
remind you that for near earth or bits
the period to go around the earth is about ninety minutes
and this speed this velocity than that you see equation two is about eight kilometers per second
and the escape velocity from that orbit would be about eleven
point two kilometers per second
and for the earth s going around the sun
the periods would be about three hundred sixty five days
and the speed of the earth in orbit is about thirty
kilometers per second just to
the trash your memory
now circular orbits are special in general
bound orbits are ellipses
even though i must add to it that
most orbits of our planet s inner solar system very close to circular but not precisely certain
but the general solutions call for a elliptical orbit
and i first
discuss with you the three famous lost by kepler
from the seventeenth century
is a brilliant statements that animate
the interesting thing is that before you made these brilliant statements he publish more nonsense in anyone else
but finally here right that to go to three golden eggs
and the first golden egg then is
that the orbits are
and it s is if we talked always about planets and the sun
this is that one poet s
that kepler s law number one
these are from around sixteen eighteen or so the second
kepler s second law is quite bizarre how we found that out amazing accomplishment
if you take it out it s
and you put the sun here at a focus is highly exaggerated was i told you that most or it s look sort of circular
and the planet goes from here to here in a certain amount of time
and you compare them with the planet going from here to here
in a certain amount of time i m then capita find out
that if this area in here
is the same as that area here
that the time to go from here to here is the same as to go from there to there
an amazing accomplishment to come up with that i d hear
and this is called equal areas
equal times
somehow whole week has the smell of some conservation of angular momenta
and then this third law also that if you take the orbital period of another it s
that is proportional to the third power
of the the distance to the sum
and he also whole pleased with that results
that he wrote juvenile and they re about it i will show you here the data that capita had available
in sixty eighty largely frond the work done by
of course astronomers of to surface like to go brought and others
you see here the six planets that were known at the time
and the mean distance to the sun
for the worst that is one because we work an astronomical units everything is reference to the distance of the earth
this is hundred fifty million kilometers
and it takes your three hundred sixty five days to go around the sun jupiter about twelve years
and saturn about thirty years
and then when he takes this number
to the power or three and this number squared any the fight the two that he gets numbers which are amazingly constant
and that is the third law is third law
and each immediately to the inverse square dependence of gravity which he was not aware but newton later put it altogether
but he s very do and they right i for us believe i was reading
but it is absolutely certain an exact
that the ratio which exists
between a periodic times of any to planets
is precisely the ratio of the three has power of the mean distance
and he wrote that in sixteen ninety
so or it s in general are
at its is
and now i want to review with you what i have there on the blackboard about it s it s you see that it s there
capital and could be the earth could be the sun is at location q
the ellipse has a semi major axes a
so the distance p two a perigee to apogee is to a
if m or the earth capital m then we would call
the point of closest approach paris g
and the point farthest away from the earth s we would call that apogee
if capital m where the sun we would call that act helium and eerie helium
so you see the
little and going in or bits you see the position vector r q it has a certain velocity v and so the
total mechanical energy is conserved the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy doesn t change
the first term is the kinetic energy one half m v squared and the second term is the potential energy
no different from equation three for circular orbits
except that now capital r
which was a fixed number in a circle is now a little r and little our changes of course with time
also that velocity v in that equation number five
will also change with time because it s an elliptical orbit it will not change in time equation number
two and in equation number three now
i give you a result which i didn t proof
and that is that the total mechanical energy
which has these two terms in it which you do fully understand
also equals minus the lamp capital m g divided by two way
and a is the semimajor axis and compare number five which number three then you see
their brothers and sisters the only change is that was capital r before is now
little a the semimajor axis
and if you
calculate the time to go around to the ellipse
then you get in equation four t squared
which is almost identical to number one for the circular orbits except that now
the radius has to be replaced by a which is a semi major axis
and the escape velocity you can calculate in exactly the same way that you calculate the escape velocity
it under the equation number four
all you do it you make the total energy is zero and then you solve equation three
and equation five and out pops the speed that you neat
to make it all the way out to infinity
and that is in the case of the
circular orbit square root of two times the
speed in orbit
so these are the numbers that we re going to use today the equations and there s one thing which is already quite remarkable and very non intuitive
very non intuitive to say the least that if you have various orbits
with have the same
semimajor axis
that the periods is the same and the energy is the same and that s by no means obvious
so this is one over it
think of it as being addicts and this is another one
this distance is the same as this distance
i ve just done in that way
that means according to equation five and six
that both orbis have exactly the same mechanical energy
and both orbits have the same periods
so to go around the circular orbit will take the same amount of time as to go around this one
and that is by no means obvious
==========
if i now want to start with a very general initial condition
offer an object little and in orbit
in an elliptical orbit and
i want to see how we can get all the information about the ellipse
that we would like to find out
somalia giving you the initial conditions so here is that it s here is
p a and here is a a
if this is another it s around the earth than this would be very genius food be apogee
the masses capital n
this is point q
get a ruler so that i can draw some nice lines
so the distance a b
equals two a a being the semimajor axis and our object happens to be here
mass little and and this
distance equals r zero think of it as being time zero
and that time to zero when it is there it has a velocity
in that ellipse
let this be t zero
and there was an angle between the position vector and v zero i call that phi zero
so i m giving you and
i m giving you v zero i m giving your r zero i m giving you phi zero and now
i m going to ask you can we find out from these initial conditions
how long a takes for this object ago around can we find out what
q p e is can we find out what the semimajor axis is can we find out what the velocity is
at point p
at closest approach and this angle is ninety degrees
and can we find out what the velocity is
when the object and the little m is farthest away apogee
can we find all these things and the answer is yes
a s the easiest to find the semimajor axis
i turn to equation number five
which is the conservation of mechanical energy
and the conservation of mechanical energy says that the total energy
is the kinetic energy plus the potential energy
equals one half m
v zero squared if that is when the object is here at location d
minus little them capital m
g divided by this r zero at location d this can never change
this is the same throughout the whole orbit
so it must also be according to equation five minus m and g divided by
to a and so you have one equation with one unknown which is a
you know all the other things m cancels am always cancels when you do with gravity so you only have a as an unknown
so that s done is the total energy were positive then
if this to for this to be positive a has to be negative that physical nonsense of course
so is only holds for bound orbits
so positive value three total i m not allowed
once you have eighty
you use so this is from equation number five
if you now apply equation number six
immediately pops out t
or it ll period because the only thing you didn t know that was a but you know way now
so we ll some no hum um a takes forty object to go around in orbit
and i try to be quantitative with you step by step is we analyze these further i will
apply this to the specific case for is someone going around the earth
everything i m telling you today
including all numerical examples i ate a handout which is six pages thick which i wrote specially for you
is we ll we ll know at were not going to print it here that s a waste of paper its nineteen ninety nine so that s we have the bat for
so you can decide on your own how many
how much snow so much time you
spend all know to to what extent you wanted concentrate and try to follow the steps it s up to you but everything is there
they truly everything every numerical example we take for capital m
we take the earth
and there it is six times ten to the twenty four kilograms
so that s my them i promise you you will know end
i will give you are zero
that is nine thousand kilometers
that s the location at that point d i give you the conditions
the speed that point d
is nine point zero kilometers per second and i ll give you five zero
is hundred and twenty degrees
everything else which you be able to calculate now from these numbers
first of all with equation five you can convince yourself sticking in these numbers that the total energy is indeed negative
course if i make the total energy positive is not another it s so that is all
it is negative it is it
it s
so with equation number five i then pop out a
right because that s one equation with one unknown
and i put in the numbers you can
confirm them and checked them at home and i find that a is quite large is about
fifty thousand kilometers that s you which that is almost
infinity not quite remember it starts off at nine thousand kilometers about
a is fifty thousand kilometers that means a hundred thousand kilometers
why is that so large
well the answer lies in
evaluating this cave velocity
this cane velocity
off this little mass
when it is at position d
for which these i d input parameters is the square root
of two n g
divided by r zero
and that is nine point four
kilometers per second well
if you need nine point four kilometers per second to make it out to infinity
and you have nine kilometers per second you pretty close already
so that s the reason why the semimajor axis is anita tremendous number it s no surprise
if now i use equation number six that i find the periods
and i find that it takes about thirty one hours for this object to go around the earth
so far so good now we want to know
what the situation is with perigee
and we is i put you can we calculate the distance q p
can we calculate the speed
at location p and at location a and now
comes r a superior knowledge
now we re going to apply for the first time in systems like this the conservation of angular momenta
angular momentum is conserved about this point q
but oh me about that point q it is not conserved about any other point that s okay
all i want is that point q that is where capital m is located
what is the magnitude of that angular momenta
well let s first take point d
when the object is sandy
the magnitude of the angular momentum is m
times v zero times r zero
times the sine of by zero
this is the situation at d
why do we have a sine phi is zero because we have a cross between our envy
and with a cross product you have this line of the angle
so that s the situation at point p
what is the situation at point p well at point p
the velocity vector is perpendicular to the line q p
so the sine of that angle is one
so now i simply get and
times v of p
times the distance q v and you can do the same four point eight
you can write down n times v of a times q a
i m not doing that you will see shortly why i m not doing that
nature is very kind that is going to give me that last part for free
the slide away is the conservation off
angular momentum about that points q where the mass is located
i have you one equation with two unknowns v of p and q p so i can solve
so any another equation of course there is another one
we have also the conservation of mechanical energy
so now we can say that the total energy
must be conserved
and a total energy
this one half i do it at point p
equals one half and
the v p squared that is the kinetic energy minus and and gee
divided by the distance cube p
this is the potential energy when the distance between capital m and it ll them is q v
but this number we know because that is minus m g divided by two way
that s sorry equation number five
whoops i slipped up here you may have noticed it i drop the little m
it should be in here
sorry for that
and so now we have here
big moment in our life that we have applied bowl smallest this is the conservation off
mechanical
energy
and now i have two equations with two and owns q p and v of p
and so i can solve for both
notice that the second equation is a quadratic equation in v of p
so you re going to get two solutions
and the two solutions
one v of p will give you the distance q p
the other one will be v a which if you d distance q a a
how come that we get bowl solutions that whole
that this is only is to pick equation
this equation doesn t know that i use the subscript p
i could ve use disk subscript a here and put in here q a that the term that i left out
and therefore when i sold the equations i
get plus v p and v a because those at situations that the velocity vector is perpendicular to the
position vector and if i use now our numerical results
and i solve for you that quadratic equation two equations with two and owns
that i find that q p
you may want to check that at home
is about six point six times ten to the third three kilometers
it means is only two hundred kilometers above the earth s surface
that that low altitude is or with whom old last very long and the satellite will we enter into the earth atmosphere
and it leads to a a speed at point p at perigee
of tenants seven to ten point seven kilometers per second it
my second solution then
is that q a
turns out to be you which
no surprise because we know that the semimajor axis is fifty thousand kilometers refined nine point three
times ten to the four kilometers
and we find from v of a
this value is fourteen times larger than this one and so the velocity will be fourteen times smaller
i think it s oh point seven five
kilometers per second guess that s what it is
the means results
the conservation of angular momentum that the product of q p and v p
must be the same as q a times v a that s immediate consequence of the conservation of
angular momentum and when i had this up q a a
plus q p i better find to a which in our case is about
hundred thousand kilometers because a was fifty thousand kilometers so when you eddies to up
you must find very close to hundred thousand and each you do
so now we know everything
there is to be known about it and that s and that came from
the initial conditions from the four numbers
that i gave you we know the periods
we know but at the jeans we d repair it is we know the orbital period
anything we want to know
now i want to
==========
get into a subject which is quite difficult
and that has to do with change of orbits
burning a lot that s when your are in orbit
and you re
or it will change
and i will do it only for
some simply fight situations i start off with a circular orbit
and i will fire the rocket in such a way
that
i will only
fired in such a way that my velocity
will either increase exactly
tangentially to the orbit
so that will increase in this direction or the atoms will decrease in this direction so if i m going in orbit like this
i either fight them iraq it s like this or if i i my rocket like this hmm
that is difficult enough what we do now
so this is r circular orbit of radius r
and at location x twelve o clock that is where i ve fire my rockets
the first thing i do i increase the kinetic energy
so i find my rocket i d blast my rocket we go in this direction i m blast my rockets in this direction
and so the speed which was a reason only this in orbit
the speed will now increase i at kinetic energy and now
i have a new speech which is higher
if my speed is higher
then my total energy has increased i increase the kinetic energy the bottom of the rocket so short
that i can consider after the berlin that the object is still that x to be very brief or
so the kinetic energy has increased the potential energy is the same so the total energy is up and therefore
the total energy
now is larger
then the total energy e that i had
in my circular orbit
but if that s the case then clearly to a
must be larger than two r
i now going to elliptical orbits because the new velocity is no longer the right velocity for a circular orbit
and so what s going to happen i m going to get
but elliptical orbits
like so
whereby to a must be larger
then two r because my total energy is larger and you see that immediately
when you go to equation number five
if you increase the total energy then your eighty will go up
okay so to a is larger than two r
that also means that the period t
must be larger than the periods
in your circular orbit
fine so far so good
my other option is that i m going to fire the rocket
when i
you out guess in this direction so i take kinetic energy out
so after the burn my speech is or
my speed is now lower
i have taken kinetic energy out
when i take kinetic energy
total energy going to be less than the circular energy
to a will be less than two r
and the orbital period will be less than the circular orbital period and therefore my new and it s
looks like this
and so these are the three situations that i want you to carefully look at because i m going to neat hmm
in the next very dramatic story which has to do with romance between peter and mary
==========
we re mary are two s months and that they are both in or bit
in one and the same orbit around the earth
this is where p r is at this moment at that location x and this is where mary is
there in exactly the same orbit but different satellites the go around like this
and they are at a distance from each other which i will expressed in terms off
a fraction s
of the total circumference so that this ark equals f
times two pi r
that so far to our part
and that means form erie
to make it all the way back
two point x would be one minus f times two pi r
so far so good
mere the forgot a lunch
radios peter and says peter i have no foot peter
contrary so our former says no sweat
i will throw you and sent which
so p of repairs and sent which and want to throw it to mary
in such a way that mary can make catch
how can either possibly do these
well
the best way the most obvious way to do it is
to make an orbit for the
and ascend which
who s orbital period is exactly the same as this time for me erie to make it back to x
and i ll be more specific by giving you some numbers then you can digest that better suppose they are in an orbit
with a radius of seven thousand kilometers
and suppose f the polls point oh five
so the separation between here and mary
is twenty two hundred kilometers so that is f times two pi r
if you know the radius r
then of course the velocity of the acid out follows immediately you have all the tools there
so we are equal seven thousand kilometers the aspen out a now stands for astronaut s is a given non ago sure a ball
and that is about seven point five five
kilometers per second
seven point if i i find
kilometers per second
and what is also non ago
a bowl is the periods to go around
which is ninety seven minutes
all of that follows from these are
okay if it takes ninety seven minutes to go around then phi i ve percent of ninety seven minutes
is five minutes the fire rounded off
so this takes five minutes ago
now ninety five percent of ninety seven minutes is ninety two minutes
so for mary to go around and go back to point x
is ninety two minutes
round it off numbers so if i can give my sense which an orbit
which has a period of ninety two minutes i go to mate
because after ninety two minutes descent which will come back to x and here is that x
this point and that you get that idea if you get that idea and all the rest will follow
so the period of the sent which after that throws peter maybe has to throw backwards
if that period is ninety two minutes and there is here she will catch sent which
and so the necessary condition for this
first solution which is an obvious one is to make
the period of this center each s is tense for sent which to make that one minus f
of the period of the s and out in orbit this is the ninety seven minutes
this is point nine five for this is ninety two minutes and this is ninety two minutes
so then do we will be back
at point x
what is the orbital periods of the cell and which after the throw well
that is four pi squared
you can find that by equation number six times a two thirds
divided by n g
to the power one half
that must be equal one minus f
times the orbital period of the ass for now to war in circular orbit so i take equation number one
so that is four pi squared
are cute divided by g n
to the power one half
there s a necessary condition
look we lose them we ll use gee we use for you to spy what don t we lose
well what we don t loose is eighty two the or three hass
e equals one minus f
times r two the power three house so a a
equals r times one minus f to the poor two thirds
and this is an amazingly simple result
it means if you know the orbits of peter and mary which is r
and if you know how far to to look what s our part which is expressed in this f
then you know what the semimajor axis is of the
sent we tore bit that comes immediately a
out of this equation but once you know the
semimajor axes you can immediately calculate with equation five the speed of dissent which
because if equation number five
will tell you that minus m n g divided by two a
a being now the semimajor axis of the sense which orbits
equals one hot end
times the velocity of this sense we choose squared this happens at location x after the burn
after the burn means after peter has flown
minus m m g e
divided by capital r because the sense which is still at location capital r
but peter has changed the speed to v s
and so once you know a this equation immediately give you v s
and once you know v s they you know with what speed peter should throw well let us
work it out in detail an example that we have there
if we calculate a
with the numbers that we have there
which you can easily confirm
because you can apply this equation for yourself you know what happens know what r is then i find that a
it s it s six thousand seven hundred and sixty five kilometers
notice that this is smaller than r it better be
the because it s clear that after this sent which is thrown that we get agree it s
we want this time to go around
to be less time then pia to go around and if
this time is a less than the time it takes to pia to go around
he has to throw the sense which backwards and therefore
you expect that the semimajor axis will be smaller than
r and this
the speed of the center which
which follows then from equation number six which was the conservation of mechanical energy is seven point four two
kilometers per second
now what matters is not so much what the speed of this n which is but what matters for peter
is what is this beat that he will have to give this and which which is v of s minus v of a
and that s you have to subtract the speed
v of s is the speed of the center which you ve a is the speed of the acid out in orbit is is minus oh point one three
kilometers per second and the minus sign show in the case that has to throw the sent which backwards so
quite amazing he s seeing mary
all the way the distance and in order to get the sent which to be re he doesn t do this but he does this
and this n which then will go into this new orbit going still forward
now any two minutes later it s here
and eerie pole where we were here so e goes for it s
ninety two minutes later this n which is here
ninety two minutes later the area is right at that point and then make the catch
now point one three kilometers per second is three hundred miles per hour which is a little tough even for peter
and so we have to look for different solutions this won t work
this was an easy one but it doesn t work well
there is no reason to rush
we can make this and which go around here is two times
and eerie three times or mere e two times
and descent which only ones as long as they need at point x there is no problem
so we have a whole family of solutions
we could have them erie
past that point x
then a times
and we can have this ends which
that s that point x and sent which times as long as the saint is yours that s perfectly fine
then ultimately if they have enough patience they will meet at point x and if you take these
these new concept into account that you can wait a certain number of plastic you through x
then the equation that you see there for the relation between a and r change is only slightly
you know get that a equals r times n of a minus f
divided by n as to the power two thirds
and if you substitute in here one and a one
which is the case that they make the cats right away
and you see indeed you get our one minus f to apollo three two thirds so that s exactly what you have their not all
solutions that you try we ll work
one solution that won t work is n a false one
and n s equals three has no solutions
and i leave you with the thought why that is the case at know solution
==========
in nineteen ninety when i lecture it s at eight oh one for the first time i s my friend and colleague george clark
to write a program so that i could show to class this pulse of the center which with the marion peter in orbit
and a cent which orbit and everything and cats and he did was a wonderful program but that row and no longer works
because that s called progress the computers have changed and so
my right hand dave pulley offers
to re write a program so that works on the thing now
and we ll going to demonstrate it to you and you can play what s it yourself it available on the home takes so whatever davis going to show you
you can do yourself
d the input parameters
but that we need for this program i the radius r r f and r n of a
and i and effects in the program will do all the rest see you can specify how many times you want married you go through point x
how many times you want the sense which to go through point x
the program will then calculate for you the speed of the center which it will also give you v l s minus v a
which is really the speed what is p has to throw it but
very cleverly the program works with a
dimensionless parameter which is this value
and this value which is v s
divided by v a
minus one is a number that is
quite unique because you get solutions which turned out to be independent of
capital z and independent of capital m
and i ll give you an example suppose you ll find for this
for this and dimensions number suppose you find minus oh point oh one seven five
which is the solution for n one
that a is one and four in essence one
so you see that the computer will generate that number for us
is now we take our orbits with seven thousand kilometers
we know what you of aids
and so we can calculate now the t v s my minus v a e
is the v eight times that number between oh what a v a is is seven point five
so you get minus oh point one seven five
times seven point five five kilometers and lo and holds that is r minus
oh point one three kilometers per second of course
it has to be that number because that s what we calculated for our case
n equals one their lists
and so this die mentioned is number is very transparent
and we will show you some examples this would be the three hundred miles scores with of course is not
very durable they ve supported you demonstrate the program and then you will see
what we can do with that program we can substitute in there quite a few
parameters that you will find no doubt interesting
you an explanation they ve
students can do with this oh let me show in an overhead here
which would help you been following
what they ve will be telling you you see there the f value
is always five percent we too
and you going to see here the numbers for
the number of times that the wreak passes through point x and a number of times that the senate little path through point
s point x this is that s very first case that we worked on together
you see that number minus oh point oh one seven
and you see indeed that it s a successful catcher let s work at that first
they ve it s explain how it works
okay we can see in the middle of the screen
is planet earth
and these two triangles represent yeah about the element is married and the redwood is peter and so the sandwich right in the middle
they start off at
the radius of
twenty two thousand kilometers from center of the year it s the default but you can change that
if you buy and we said and eight and and that s through these
pulled down menus so some both sort of one and one now
and we have the program to calculate the value for is of this the men s was parameter and it comes up with it and the monies that about you
and so we had everything set and and this number i take is minus oh point oh one seven five et cetera yeah try to read them
edison um hum yes the program to prepare the tossed put this one down here and when it s ready they d green played but will become active
and when it and that happens again click on that and it ll play the tossed course
peter always throw as that x in twelve lot of that o clock
there goes the sent which we see a center it s great sent which
bake sent which
to notice that send which makes it around exactly it the same time
for mary
to be happy now
there s no reason why we shouldn t try one too
so that means myriad
reaches point x but the senate when twice around the earth
there s no problem with the solution in principle
but you have to be quite far away from the earth if you re too close to the earth
like dave sure or beat which has a radius of only twenty two thousand kilometers something very
catastrophic will happen and okay so now i
send in as to to
my dad called the men and we ask you to prepare the tallest again and goes through
it s
numerical calculations of the orbit
and when it s ready oh what a snow
and now i can now what s that sauce
then goes ascends which
once ago right you re slice but it s the earth
that s to bet
if you make this that mentioned is predator minus one
the enemy of s is zero
and what doesn t mean that fee of s is zero that this n which then still
has no speed northern anymore
and so what happens with the other it s that becomes radio handful they ve
okay so if the money s our own body if the cement is parameter emitting
this octave year
and
put in whatever remarked to put a minus one
and we make sure that the programs
use our about you
and set it out they buy in this case these these numbers of matter and and and as they re relevant because the program as many years are about you
we ask you to prepare demise one over right everything else now yes
by chris calculations and now you can see what happens
golf clock there goes the center it now peter the sites at one points
that instead of throwing ascent which backwards
you can also throw this n which for it because look we have here the red it it s
there s no reason why mirror
koreans go
twice two x one twice and then this end which
would make a larger and it s
and meet here when they re e has gun around twice then of course this ends which has to be thrown forward
and so peter makes a calculation for what we call the two one situation
the real goes twice through x this and which goes one to x
but peter made a mistake be to go nervous and he puts in the wrong parameters
and you will see what happens they will first show you the right parameters
ugh it so if we would ve that s the program to calculate a pretty decent to one
it d come up with a bow you for this immense us from very point one six five nine there s something there abouts
but you know you made is in this calculation and humans use point one six four
so
this is will put into the program and will prepare the tossing see what happens
with the saudis
that an ounce ready for me relying hungry by now
there we go now i go forward you can see that you see ghost for that goes a very large ellipse
and the re will go around twice and eerie is here
t this end this is only halfway
and if peter had only done it right
there is troubles would now soon be ole for
but peter made this small mistake and
the every cannot catch it
if you make this dimensional is parameter plus point four two
that it s very easy to convince yourself that ascends which must be a plus
we ll have the escape velocity from the orbits
maybe he ll angry at one point that marry you never know about the situations and
he threw it very fast and they will show you what happens then okay
and it goes to infinity
and it won t the fresh anymore when it gets there
okay see you friday
